    <p class="ab-des-txt">
        Although South Asian communities possess a relationship with football that stretches back almost 130 years, there have been very few success stories.  
        <br>
        In 2021 there were only ten British Asian professional footballers competing in England out of approximately 4,000 despite there being a population of 3.6 million in England and Wales. Just six British Asian footballers between the ages of 16 to 18 years old were attached to the 72 Football League academies in 2009 out of over 1,300 players.  
        <br>
        Football within South Asian environments continue to be underdeveloped. Traditionally there has been a lack of emphasis placed on youth football, and players from South Asian heritage   
        <br>
        The Players Corner wants to address the underrepresentation of South Asian players and coaches within football. It aims to act as a voice  
        <br>
        began primarily due to the lack of football pathways within the community,  
        <br>
        this coincided with the figures released by the FA on how underrepresented the Black, Asian & Minority Ethnic (BAME) community was in football.  
    </p>
    <p class="ab-note-txt">
        Bains and Patel’s key findings suggested that football within predominantly South Asian heritage environments was underdeveloped; there had traditionally been a lack of emphasis placed on youth football; football insiders tend to physically and culturally stereotype British Asian players; and methods of player recruitment naturally discriminated against Asian heritage players.

    <p class="ab-sub-hdr">Mission</p>
    <p class="ab-des-txt" style="opacity: .9">Our aim is to educate our community about football. So, as a community we can be taken seriously within the game.</p>
    <p class="ab-des-txt">The consensus was that Asians Can’t Play Football d <br> other local clubs were non-representative of our community and did little in the way of benefiting the community. They were also not a visible presence in the community, three things we wanted to ensure we could change.  </p>
    
    <p class="ab-sub-hdr">Core Values</p>
    <ul class="ab-list">
        <li>To address the issue of how underrepresented the South Asian community as whole are in football.  </li>
        <li>To focus on actions that will benefit the whole community.  </li>
        <li>To create a visible presence and an identity within the community. </li>
        <li>To work with schools, agencies, and social groups to enhance community contribution. </li>
        <li>To provide opportunities for children and youth to fulfil their potential through football. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="ab-sub-hdr">Who are we?</p>
    <p class="ab-des-txt">We are already a Middlesex affiliated football club (X-MID2820). We are a community grassroots football club, operating as a non-profit, looking to become the first ALL-INCLUSIVE club in Middlesex. <br><br>
        We currently have adult men's and women's teams and will be introducing, for the first time, youth teams this summer. We have recently started Walking Football. And we are also working on football sessions for girls and disability football.</p>
