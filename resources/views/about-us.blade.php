    <p class="ab-des-txt">The consensus was that Asians Can’t Play Football d <br> other local clubs were non-representative of our community and did little in the way of benefiting the community. They were also not a visible presence in the community, three things we wanted to ensure we could change.  </p> --}}

    <p class="ab-sub-hdr">Who are <span>We?</span></p>
    <p class="ab-des-txt">
        Football is by far the number one sport and there is a lot of talent to be found. Sadly, millions of (unregistered) players possess the ability to make a career in football but miss out on the opportunity because they don’t get the right training and coaching or have negative experiences with illegal scouts and agents who are not delivering what they promise. 
        <br><br>
        We are here to ensure that every talent gets the opportunity to be recognised, appreciated, and nurtured by providing the necessary support a player needs to succeed in football. The best teams in the world have two or three outstanding individuals who can make a difference. We want to develop strong talent who are capable of unlocking matches.
