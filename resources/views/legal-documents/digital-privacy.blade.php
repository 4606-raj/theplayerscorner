            We only do this through email, SMS, automated phone calls or online direct messaging (such as using any private message facility on the Club website or as may be permitted on associated social media platforms) where you have agreed, so this is on the basis of your consent. However, if you are an existing member/supporter of the Club, we may contact you about our products or services similar to those you have previously received or enquired about (unless you have chosen not to receive such communications).
            <br><br>
            
            You can change your mind or adjust your preferences any time afterwards either in your personal profile page (also known as a ‘preference centre’) which is accessible from all of our emails or emailing us at <a href="mailto: privacy@southallathleticfc.com">privacy@southallathleticfc.com</a>.

This will usually be necessary for our legitimate interests to study how customers use our products/services, to develop them, to grow our business and to inform our commercial and marketing strategy.
            
            <br><br>
            We may also process your personal data for other reasons, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

        <b>In brief…</b>Access or object to use of your data; have your data corrected, erased, transferred, or used only in a restricted way; complain to us or the Information Commissioner; withdraw consent to use your data. Some rights are only available in limited circumstances.   
    </div>
    <p class="lg-des-txt">Under the Data Protection Laws, you may have the following rights in relation to your personal data in certain circumstances: </p>
    
    <ul type="square">
        <li><b>Request Access:</b> (also known as a "data subject access request"). You can receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><b>Request Correction:</b> You can have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of new data you provide.</li>
        <li><b>Request Deletion:</b> You can ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain circumstances, for example where: there is no good reason for us continuing to process it; you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (below); or where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</li>
        <li><b>Object to Processing of your personal data:</b> This applies where: we are relying on a legitimate interest or those of a third party (see the <a href="privacy_policy.html">“What do we use your personal data for?”</a> section above) and you feel our processing on this ground impacts your fundamental rights; or where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.</li>
        <li><b>Request Restriction of Processing:</b> You can ask us to suspend processing of your personal data where: you want us to establish the data's accuracy; our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
        <li><b>Request Transfer:</b> You can ask us to provide to you, or a third party of your choice, your personal data in a machine-readable format. This right only applies to automated information which: you initially provided consent for us to use your data (see the <a href="privacy_policy.html">“What do we use your personal data for?”</a> section above); or your provided and we used the information to perform a contract with you (see the <a href="privacy_policy.html">“What do we use your personal data for?”</a> section above).</li>
        <li><b>Right to withdraw consent:</b> This only applies where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (see the <a href="privacy_policy.html">“What do we use your personal data for?”</a> section above). If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>

Please note we may not always be able to comply with your request due to our legitimate interests or other legal reasons. If applicable, these will be notified to you in response to a relevant request.</p>
    <p class="lg-des-txt">You will not usually have to pay a fee to exercise any of the above rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive (or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances).</p>
